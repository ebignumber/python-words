puzzle_creator.py:

1. How does it work.

The puzzle creator allows you to make your own series of puzzles. You start off at a screen that looks like a bash terminal:
___________________________
|Type "help" for help     |
|                         | 
|puzzle_creator/Custom$   | 
___________________________

Here, you type commands to create puzzles or edit them. If you need help with the commands, you can type help, or look at the "Commands" section of this documentation.


Commands:

*add


Syntax: add "direction":"x":"y""word"

This command adds a word to the puzzle. direction can be either "r" for right or "d" for down, x and y can be between 0 and 14 and word can be any word that contains only letters (no numbers or punctuation).

If the word is out of bounds, you will get an error, and the word won't be added to the puzzle

*add_word

Syntax: add_word "word"

Shortcut to add a horizontal word in the upper-left corner of the puzzle.


*autodisplay

This command makes it so that the puzzle is automatically displayed after every command. If you want to turn off the autodisplay feature, just type the command again.


*display

Syntax: display

Displays the puzzle in a 15 by 15 grid, and the words that are in the puzzle. Like in this example:
